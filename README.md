# StatsBomb American Football Open Data

Welcome to the StatsBomb American Football Open Data repository.

StatsBomb are committed to sharing new data and research publicly to enhance understanding of the game of football. We want to actively encourage new research and analysis at all levels. Therefore we have made certain subsets of StatsBomb Data freely available for public use for research projects and genuine interest in football analytics.

StatsBomb are hoping that by making data freely available, we will extend the wider football analytics community and attract new talent to the industry.
